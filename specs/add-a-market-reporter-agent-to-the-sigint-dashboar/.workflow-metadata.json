  "feature_description": "Add a Market Reporter agent to the SIGINT dashboard that curates and displays financial market data as a compact ticker strip. Requirements: 1) New MARKETS category in the Category enum 2) Use CoinGecko API for crypto prices (BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, XRP) - no new API keys needed 3) The LLM agent picks the most interesting/notable price movements (big risers/fallers >5% moves) to highlight 4) Raw price display doesn't need LLM, but selecting which ones to feature prominently does 5) Ticker-style horizontal scrolling display in frontend, not card-based 6) 5-minute update frequency via EventBridge 7) Follow existing reporter pattern in lambdas/reporters/handler.py 8) Add market-focused prompt in llm_client.py for selecting notable movers",
