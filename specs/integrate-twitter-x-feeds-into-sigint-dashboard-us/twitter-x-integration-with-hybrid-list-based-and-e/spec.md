## Overview

This feature integrates Twitter/X platform data using a hybrid approach combining list-based monitoring and event-driven search capabilities. It enables deep narrative correlation analysis powered by AI/ML models to identify patterns, trends, and relationships across social media content as part of an initial pilot program.

## Problem Statement

Organizations need to monitor and analyze Twitter/X content at scale to understand emerging narratives, detect coordinated campaigns, and correlate social media activity with broader events. Current solutions lack the ability to combine structured list monitoring with dynamic event-driven search while providing intelligent narrative analysis.

## User Stories

### US1 - Configure Twitter/X List Monitoring (Priority: P0)

As a **analyst**, I want to **configure and manage Twitter/X lists for continuous monitoring**, so that **I can track specific accounts, topics, or communities relevant to my investigation without manual searching**.

**Independent Test**: Create a new list configuration with a valid Twitter list ID, verify it appears in the monitoring dashboard, and confirm data collection begins within the specified frequency window.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. User can create, edit, and delete Twitter/X list configurations
2. User can specify list IDs or URLs for monitoring
3. System validates list accessibility before saving configuration
4. User can set monitoring frequency (real-time, hourly, daily)
5. Configuration changes take effect within 5 minutes

### US2 - Execute Event-Driven Searches (Priority: P0)

As a **analyst**, I want to **trigger searches based on specific events, keywords, or conditions**, so that **I can dynamically capture relevant Twitter/X content when breaking events occur without pre-configuring all possible scenarios**.

**Independent Test**: Configure an event-driven search with a specific hashtag trigger, simulate the trigger condition, and verify that matching tweets are collected and displayed within the expected timeframe.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. User can define search queries using Twitter/X search operators
2. User can set event triggers (keyword detection, time-based, external webhook)
3. Search results are collected and stored within 2 minutes of trigger activation
4. User can view search history and results
5. System supports Boolean operators and advanced query syntax

### US3 - View Correlated Narrative Analysis (Priority: P0)

As a **analyst**, I want to **view AI-generated narrative correlations across collected Twitter/X data**, so that **I can quickly identify related content, emerging themes, and potential coordinated activity without manually reviewing thousands of posts**.

**Independent Test**: Collect data from a known topic with multiple related tweets, run narrative correlation analysis, and verify that semantically related content is grouped together with appropriate confidence scores.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. System displays narrative clusters with confidence scores
2. User can drill down into individual narratives to see supporting tweets
3. Correlations include temporal, semantic, and network-based relationships
4. Results update as new data is collected
5. User can export correlation reports

### US4 - Manage Twitter/X API Authentication (Priority: P0)

As a **admin**, I want to **configure and manage Twitter/X API credentials and rate limits**, so that **I can ensure the system has proper access to Twitter/X data while staying within API usage limits**.

**Independent Test**: Add new API credentials, verify successful authentication with Twitter/X API, and confirm rate limit monitoring displays accurate usage statistics.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Admin can add, update, and revoke API credentials
2. System displays current rate limit status and usage
3. System automatically handles rate limiting with backoff strategies
4. Admin receives alerts when approaching rate limits
5. Credentials are stored securely with encryption

### US5 - Train Custom Narrative Models (Priority: P1)

As a **data scientist**, I want to **train and deploy custom ML models for domain-specific narrative detection**, so that **I can improve correlation accuracy for specialized use cases beyond general-purpose models**.

**Independent Test**: Upload a labeled dataset, initiate model training, verify training completion, and compare model performance metrics against the baseline model.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. User can upload labeled training data
2. System provides model training interface with configurable parameters
3. User can evaluate model performance with test datasets
4. Trained models can be deployed to production pipeline
5. User can A/B test models against baseline

### US6 - Access Integration via API (Priority: P1)

As a **developer**, I want to **programmatically access Twitter/X integration features via REST API**, so that **I can build custom workflows and integrate the capability into existing tools and dashboards**.

**Independent Test**: Authenticate with the API, create a list configuration programmatically, execute a search, and retrieve results through the API endpoints.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. API endpoints available for list management, search execution, and results retrieval
2. API documentation is complete with examples
3. API supports authentication via API keys and OAuth
4. Rate limiting is applied per API consumer
5. Webhook callbacks available for async operations

### US7 - Monitor System Health and Performance (Priority: P1)

As a **admin**, I want to **view real-time system health metrics and performance dashboards**, so that **I can ensure the integration is operating correctly and identify issues before they impact users**.

**Independent Test**: Access the health dashboard, verify all metrics are populating correctly, trigger a known error condition, and confirm the alert system activates appropriately.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Dashboard displays data collection success/failure rates
2. Dashboard shows ML model inference latency and throughput
3. Alerts configured for anomalous behavior
4. Historical performance data available for trend analysis
5. System logs accessible for debugging

### US8 - Configure Narrative Correlation Rules (Priority: P2)

As a **analyst**, I want to **define custom rules and thresholds for narrative correlation**, so that **I can tune the system to reduce false positives and focus on the most relevant correlations for my specific use case**.

**Independent Test**: Create a custom correlation rule with specific thresholds, apply it to a dataset, and verify that results reflect the configured parameters.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. User can set minimum confidence thresholds for correlations
2. User can define custom correlation rules based on metadata
3. User can whitelist/blacklist specific accounts or keywords
4. Rules can be saved as templates for reuse
5. Changes to rules trigger re-analysis of existing data
